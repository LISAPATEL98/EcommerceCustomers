# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation 


<h>Warehouse optimization</h><br>
Within this notebook I analyzed sales data of an UK online retailer. As storage area may be expensive and fast delivery on time is important to prevail over the competition we like to help the retailer by predicting daily amounts of sold products.

This analysis was divided into 4 parts :
<li>EDA and Data Cleaning
<li>Sales Trend Analysis & Pareto Analysis
<li>Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value Analysis (RFM)
<li>Product Recommendation for customer & Apriori analysis to promote Basket sales

<b>Sales Trend Analysis & Pareto Analysis<br></b>
This purpose of this analysis was to recognize customer purchasing patterns. Recognizing weekly & monthly trends for all the transcations & categorizing products.
The end goal here was to get mangerial insights such as what were the days with most sales, best promotional offers, discount offers. This analysis could be used for further re-stocking & planning.


<b>Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value Analysis (RFM)<br></b>
In this analysis, customers were categorized into silver, gold, platinum based on their transaction history.<br>The main focus was to answer these 3 questions
<br>Recency – "How recently did the customer purchase?"
<br>Frequency – "How often do they purchase?"
<br>Monetary Value – "How much do they spend?"
<br>This purpose of this analysis was to retain high-valued customers & create plans for the customers which might led in revenue increase

<b>Product Recommendation for customer & Apriori analysis<br></b>
Product recommendation using Natural Language Processing to understand the "trending products" by leveraging data on the most purchased items for a given time period. Creating clusters of similar buying pattern helps to identify the products of interest, which could be shown to customers of the same cluster.
<br>The algorithm creates recommendations such as :If the seller wants to uplift the sale of Chocolates, clubbing it with Marshmallows as a basket would have 34 times more change of getting picked up by the customer. <br>This technique could be used to club items to increase the sale of underselling items or for items with nearing expiry date.
